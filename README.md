# how a name birthday song made my best friend's day unexpectedly special

okay so i need to share this thing because it was genuinely wholesome and also kind of funny and i'm still thinking about it weeks later. but first, some context because this didn't come out of nowhere.

my friend sarah - you know the type, the one who somehow remembers everyone's birthday and puts actual effort into gifts while you're over here like "here's a card i bought five minutes ago" - her birthday was coming up last month. and i wanted to do something that felt personal but didn't require me to spend weeks planning or stressing about it. i'd already done the whole generic gift thing in previous years and wanted to switch it up this time.

so i'm doomscrolling during my lunch break, mildly panicking because her birthday is in two days and i have absolutely nothing, and somehow i came across this site that makes personalized birthday songs with your name in them. and honestly, my first thought was "this is probably going to be terrible" because i've seen those cringey personalized birthday videos from like 2008 that sound absolutely awful and are just uncomfortable for everyone involved.

but i was curious and also desperate, so i figured why not. the whole process was just... surprisingly simple? you put in the person's name, choose a style that fits their vibe, and that's kind of it. within a couple minutes, i had this song that just had her name woven throughout it in a way that didn't feel forced or awkward or like it was recorded in someone's basement.

i sent it to her on her birthday morning with a message that said "play this before coffee" and waited. five minutes later, my phone starts blowing up with all these texts like "OMG HOW DID YOU EVEN DO THIS" and "THIS IS ACTUALLY SO CUTE" and "I'M LITERALLY CRYING MY ROOMMATE THINKS I'VE LOST IT."

then she sends me this video of herself dancing in her kitchen. in her pajamas. at 7am. just vibing to this [name birthday song](https://birthdaysongwithname.com/) with her name in it. and honestly, that was worth more than any wrapped gift i could have bought her.

what i wasn't expecting was how much actual use she'd get out of it. like, she didn't just listen to it once and forget about it. she put it on her instagram story (people kept asking me where i got it), played it during her family zoom call, even set it as her alarm for a week until she admitted it was "a lot to wake up to your own name every morning but honestly? worth it."

since then, i've used it for my nephew's 10th birthday (he said it was "actually cool" which is huge from a 10-year-old), my coworker's farewell thing, and even my dad's 60th (he acted like it was whatever but i caught him humming it to himself later so). every time people are just... genuinely happy? it's weirdly satisfying.

the thing i like about it is that it's not another physical thing that's going to end up in a closet or a drawer. you know what i mean? like, we all have so much stuff already. this is just this little moment that's specifically about them, which sounds cheesy typed out but watching my friend dance in her kitchen to her own birthday song was honestly better than any wrapped gift i've ever given anyone.

and it takes what, five minutes? no shipping, no wrapping, no hoping it fits or matches their apartment or whatever. just a thing with their name on it that they can share or keep or vibe to in their kitchen at 7am.

my friend still listens to hers sometimes when she's having a rough day, which is more than i can say for literally anything else i've ever gotten anyone. and that feels like a win.

if you're also staring at your calendar like "how do i make this person feel special without spending two weeks planning or $50 on something they might not even want" - idk, give it a try. or don't. i'm not your boss. but it's been a hit every time i've used it, and i'm kind of mad i didn't find this thing sooner.
